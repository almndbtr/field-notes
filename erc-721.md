# ERC-721

### ELI5

The "N" stands for "non", or not.

The "F" means "fungible", which means "tradable" or "switchable."

The "T" means "token", like a coin.

"Non-fungible" means that it is one-of-a-kind.

"Non-fungible token" is like a one-of-a-kind coin.

There are many NFTs that look alike, and even some that could _look_ the same!

But, what makes the NFT one-of-a-kind is the details which we can read from a computer.

### ELI18

This is a way of defining a non-fungible token (also known as a deed) on the Ethereum blockchain.

The formal specification is available in [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).&#x20;

### Example: ZORB token&#x20;

[Zorbs (ZORB)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xca21d4228cdcc68d4e23807e5e370c07577dd152) is a commemorative NFT celebrating the one-year anniversary of the [Zora](https://zora.co) protocol. [Zorb Minter](https://zorb.dev) is the site where you can mint this token to cement your status as an early supporter of Zora. The token is free, but you will need to pay the [gas fee](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227-User-Guide-Gas).&#x20;

This [transaction](erc-721.md#example-zorb-token) shows my mint of `Zorb #9144`:
