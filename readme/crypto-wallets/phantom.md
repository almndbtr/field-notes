# ðŸ‘» Phantom

[Phantom](https://phantom.app) is a crypto wallet for the Solana blockchain.

They make it safe and easy for anyone to store, send, receive, stake, and swap tokens on Solana.

### Seven wonderful features

1. Non-custodial: I manage the private keys. Phantom never has access to any of my data or funds.
2. Token swaps: they have a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap tokens. I haven't used this at all in favor of [Orca.so](https://www.orca.so), but it seems nice!
3. NFTs and Collectibles: the gallery is _exceptional_ compared to MetaMask (no gallery), OpenSea, Rarible, and many others, in my humble opinion. The [Rainbow Ethereum Wallet](https://rainbow.me) has a good interface, but I've found it clunky in the case of rendering music NFTs.
4. Ledger Support: I have a Ledger hardware wallet that is compatible with Phantom.
5. Web3 Support: I've connected with many applications built on Solana using Phantom and, I'm hard-pressed to find another wallet to use unless an app required it.
6. SOL Staking: admittedly, I've never used this either in favor of liquid staking pools on [Socean.fi](https://www.socean.fi/app).
7. Security: [there's an entire page dedicated to this](https://phantom.app/security).

### Download Phantom

Go to [https://phantom.app/download](https://phantom.app/download) and choose the browser of your liking. I've been using it with Brave and it's been a delight since day zero.

### Solana dApps
