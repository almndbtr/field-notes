# ERC-721

This is a standard way of defining a non-fungible token (also known as a deed) on the Ethereum blockchain. The formal specification is available in [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).&#x20;

### What is ERC?

ERC is Ethereum Request \[for] Comments.

****[**Ethereum**](https://ethereum.org) is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications.&#x20;

****[**Request for Comments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request\_for\_Comments) **** is a publication in a series, from its principal technical development and standards-setting groups for the internet.

All ERCs are available at [https://eips.ethereum.org/erc](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc).

### What is EIP?

EIP is [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org).&#x20;

They describe standards for the Ethereum platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Network upgrades are discussed separately in the [Ethereum Project Management](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/) repository.

### What does 721 stand for?

`721` represents the issue number on GitHub. In this instance, that would be [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).&#x20;

Once an EIPS is accepted, it is published in the `ethereum/EIPs` repository. Check out [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md).&#x20;

### Reading the metadata of an ERC-721 token

#### Using Etherscan

If you know the address of the ERC-721 token or the wallet address that it belongs to, you can use [Etherscan](http://etherscan.io), the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer, to inspect its metadata.

#### Using a third-party website

Some companies/groups/DAOs also provide a separate website for inspecting metadata. For example, given [`Zorb #9144`](https://zorb.dev/nft/9144), there's a link to [its profile on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152?a=9144) in addition to [its profile on zora.co](https://zora.co/collections/0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152/9144):&#x20;

#### Using Developer Tooling

> _Assume the Etherscan, Zora, and Zorb Minter websites are unavailable. However, you can access the Ethereum blockchain directly using other tools. How do you "read" the details of `Zorb #9144` and generate the image yourself?_

🤔This section is in progress. Here are some ideas:

* Deploy a proof-of-concept using [Audius' fetch-nft package](https://github.com/AudiusProject/fetch-nft)
* Deploy a proof-of-concept using Ethereum's suggested [Developer Tooling](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/)&#x20;

At a high-level, this is what's in my head:

* Find the token and the address it belongs to
* Find an API-like interface that you can `GET` the token and the address
* Read out (deserialize) the token and its metadata
