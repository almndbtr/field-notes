# ERC-721

### ELI18

This is a way of defining a non-fungible token (also known as a deed) on the Ethereum blockchain.

The formal specification is available in [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).&#x20;

### Example: ZORB token&#x20;

[Zorbs (ZORB)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xca21d4228cdcc68d4e23807e5e370c07577dd152) is a commemorative NFT celebrating the one-year anniversary of the [Zora](https://zora.co) protocol. [Zorb Minter](https://zorb.dev) is the site where you can mint this token to cement your status as an early supporter of Zora. The token is free, but you will need to pay the [gas fee](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404600179227-User-Guide-Gas).&#x20;

This [transaction](erc-721.md#example-zorb-token) shows my mint of `Zorb #9144`:

**Update!** As of [https://github.com/ourzora/zorb/pull/21](https://github.com/ourzora/zorb/pull/21), there's now an option to download any ZORB from the site: just click ðŸ’¾ `Download SVG` (works best on Desktop). If you're using mobile, I recommend "holding" the link and opening it a new tab so you can download it or screenshot it.

This Zorb (along with its siblings) can be viewed on these sites:

* [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152?a=9144)
* [Zora](https://zora.co/collections/0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152/9144)
* [Zorb Minter](https://zorb.dev/nft/9144)

#### Technical Specifics

* Contract: [0xCa21d4228cDCc68D4e23807E5e370C07577Dd152](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca21d4228cdcc68d4e23807e5e370c07577dd152)
* Zorb project monorepo: [`ourzora/zorb`](https://github.com/ourzora/zorb)``

#### Questions

* Assume the Etherscan, Zora, and Zorb Minter websites are unavailable. However, you can access the Ethereum blockchain directly using other tools. How do you "read" the details of `Zorb #9144` and generate the image yourself?
