# Zoratopia | Feb 2, 2022

### Meta

* February 2, 2022 | 4:00PM - 5:30PM PST

### Notes

* Chat Intros
* Dee Goens, Co-Creator of Zora
  * Bounced overseas to go to Imperial College London; no standardized test to get in — loophole! Got to travel, and worked out well.
  * Started to hear about blockchain and crypto; originally BTC for buying stuff, but towards the latter part the stay, worked as a consultant, and as an auditor
  * Heard of Ethereum in 2016
  * Wrote a paper called Securing The Chain
  * Went on LinkedIn, searched for jobs, there was a job for CoinBase for IT Risk Manager — stopped doing that workpaper and wrote a DM to the recruiter, and that kicked off the whole CoinBase side of the journey
  * Was there through the 2017 ride and scaling issues that they went through and first-hand experience and high-performing crypto organization
  * Seeing the talent and big-thinking, they hired alot of people to make it happen, and it was a great learning experience — in 2020, left Coinbase to start Zora with co-founder Jacob Horne, pivoted into NFTs, hired Latasha after the protocol dropped.
* Latasha: why make transition into this space?
  * Dee: early days at CoinBase 2017 — it was relatively small, and had this opportunity, but less of a “corp” corp, and didn’t have all of that readiness stuff happening, and having boots on the ground, and it was exhilirating work. As the company transitioned to a more corporate entity, there was a more “big tech co” feel happening, and Dee still had ambitions to work on like side projects or looking to start a DAO on Saint Fame — Jacob was going to do a panel at the NBA, and as a part of working with each other, what if we had an OVO DAO or something like this? Or TV shows with NFT characters? We were a sounding board for each other and revved each other program. There was a lot of corporate red tape around it and we came back from that, and Jacob called me like “I’m at this cafe, you want to meet me up here?” Jacob said “I’m quitting! I want you to quit with me!” And we decided to both quit and start Zora.
  * We grabbed Tyson as well
  * The transition felt freeing in a lot of ways, from the impact on the cultural side
  * It was daunting in a lot of ways, as I left the comforts of the biggest brand in crypto — so we were losing some of the, “big bro” that we had and so — that was daunting
  * You don’t realize it until you start a store to —
  * Then the pandemic happened.
  * We already quit our jobs and we were already out of a job, we said the goodbyes and got the emails from the bosses. Coinbase Ventures invested in Zora but it was daunting!
  * Steve and Khan Yi came through as well, led the seed and getting money in the bank, and it was a relief to hire build and all that said — I didn’t have a rolodex of clients, and not sure what to sell, but it was an exciting time. It was unique in a lot of ways and it was cool and difficult at the same time.
* LATASHA: How did Zora transition from something before to NFTs?
  * Dee: we have a picture somewhere with all of us pulling out. There was a lot of like attachment to the store, and it was risky! Jacob was like, amazing in putting you in either OR decisions — it was binary in a lot of ways, so we’re either all in on NFTs or we’re not. We had all these decisions —
  * We all had 7 different hats and points, and it was in OCtober and decided to go all in!
  * There’s a memo on twitter, we put out a memo in glowing texts files — there’s announcement on nfts.
* Manifesto
  * Dee: collaborative effort.
  * We worked with an agency to hone the focus, shout out to Dina Carson and Toby
  * Pivot: Asked — should we take our own cut?
  * We brought the whole “f\*\*\* them” and shipped it
  * That collaborative process took two weeks or so and fine tuning until we felt it was in a place where we can ship it
  * After ship, we had Lily, our amazing Brand Design Engineer just talented — she redesigned the entire page that the Manifesto lives on today!
    * [https://zora.co/manifesto](https://zora.co/manifesto)
  * Manifesto is very inspirational for other teams as well
* LATASHA: how do you define Zora and see it?
  * Dee: It’s the marketplace protocol for the internet or of the internet. To use from Jacob, the definition is the hyperstructure!
  * [https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)
* LATASHA: why this route than marketplace regular route?
  * Dee: when we built the store, we were adding a lot of value. We used to charge extractive / curatorial fees. Protocol side, we were inspired by Uniswap, and we don’t think we need to extract a fee to make infra valuable. It doesn’t make sense to use Zora — it’s a public utility to fluidly share their thoughts and creations and minting their imagination.
  * It didn’t feel right to do that.
  * Just pay for the gas for it only!
  * We won’t curate, and there’s no curatorial value here. It’s a piece of public infra, so what are we charging people for?
  * Read more: Uniswap —[https://uniswap.org/](https://uniswap.org)
  * We don’t like it feeling like a tax or rent-seeking behavior. We don’t want to be landlords in the creator economy. We want to see it become a public utility and not get charged by going to the library!
* LATASHA: Zora V3 — let’s talk about v2 versus v3, and evolution
  * Dee: V3 makes it easier for artists and creators as well as for builders to do the things they wanted to do since we dropped V2.
  * V2 was a little heavy on gas, and limited on minting or listing or Zora NFTS, but V3 supports the entire universe of ERC-721 and ERC-1155
  * Jacob and I have been setting up tutorials for royalties and such, if anyone needs help!
* LATASHA: What do you think the future of Zora is going to be like?
  * Interfaces and sites built on the Zora Protocol
  * Platformless media to emerge
* LATASHA: ZORADAO is coming
* LATASHA: If extra alpha, what do you want to share with the Zoratopia folks?
  * Dee: ZORBS MATTER

#### Open Q\&A

* CECdontCEASE.eth: It seems like what you endured in the pandemic, but it also gave you conviction to make Zora possible.
  * Dee: We remind ourselves of how hard it was to get to where we are today. We’re betting on ourself and that was the first time as a time to make those bets, and down the line, the decision to not go forward with sales, we don’t need this money right now or choose to — we have been particular about investors, we had to pick and choose. Those little habits you make on yourself accumulate to a place where we pivot the whole business. It feels crazy but has so much gumption. We’re all kind of like, we are a disagree and commit team and if there’s a problem, I don’t want to hear complain, I wanna hear how you wanna fix it. You build this mental fortitude, and go with that 100.
* It seems like a lot of different ways to pivot. You build with Ethereum’s protocols and more blockchains are building bridges and EVM in the way that build infgra — is Zora taking advantage to be more blockchain agnostic?
  * Dee: yes in a nutshell. Also, bridges are dangerous, but we want to prepare for ourselves a multi-chain world in the future. Maybe slight alpha — last weekend, Tyson, our CTO and Solidity Guru deployed V3 of the protocol onto Polygon.
* raays: Thanks everyone for putting this on! Technical specifics of gas have evaded me, and it can be prohibitive.
  * It depends on the transaction. Transfers are different from minting, and it depends on the metadata that is being processed. When you see teams that are optimizing for gas efficiency, you are seeing people make transactions lighter from that perspective to process on the Ethereum blockchain.
  * The more novel areas of our space is being gas efficient.
* raays: on L2 conversation, they’re putting little bits of data
* Tipz: L2 support for indexing?
  * Dee: active work happening!
* Q: “Will Zora team add the possibilities for creators to deploy their own smart contract?”
  * Dee: When it comes to, there’s a lot of amazing tooling that’s built in the community today. That could be a Manifold, or Foundation. But we want the artist to own that, and make the experience as great as possible.
  * This is tricky: we’re less concerned with the rest of this quarter with the actual contract creation side, because we love a lot of the tools out there! But what we want to do is to support the marketplace infrastructure side.
* Danny: there’s a lot of music platforms. Soundxyz, Royal, etc. What is the difference between them all? What is difference between one over the other?
  * Dee: This might be a good artist first answer!
  * LATASHA: all of these platforms are amazing — they all have different qualities. It’s about the intention you want to bring with what you’re releasing. Catalog is ONLY 1/1 auctions and you can do splits there, and when I think of Catalog, I think the most exclusive records that I want to see one person own. As for Audius, they are not in the same realms as Catalog or Sound.xyz, but they don’t have the same sort of sell model. You can put your music up and put your music to it — it’s more of a streaming platform. You can get it over the next couple of months and space of audience, but [sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz) is dope and I’m doing a drop this Friday with them, but they are an editions. Instead of 1/1, you can have certain amount — it’s 25 - 80 editions like Bandcamp on NFTs and super fire. There’s an application process for soundxyz and Catalog — it takes time.
  * Zora is an EVERYTHING platform! You can’t put cover art with audio, but you can put cover art on Zora and put music videos as you all have seen and there are other platforms that do music videos like Glass Protocol and Prizm.
  * Dee: here’s the kicker - why Zora is crazy kickass. Everything she talked about — all of these marketplaces which allow for video, music, or whatever — all built on Zora. All of that Ecosystem is built on top of Zora protocol which is why we think it is super special.
* Dee: Market Module | we can vote on it, and deploy what Tyson will built because you say you wanted it — built the modular architecture so we can deploy those! There will be more auction types.
* Dom: I minted my first on Zora and it was funny, because I believe that V3 launched the next day — question: for smart contracts, as someone who is new into it, I have one song pretty recently and would I like to look at smart contracts? It feels like so far, it’s too early like I don’t need it right now. With LATASHA’s work, when did you feel like it’s necessary to look at smart contracts?
  * LATASHA: depends on how deep in the rabbit hole. Practice with the different platforms that are available. You don’t have to worry about commissions or anything like that. I don’t have a smart contract yet and been here for a year, but wanna do it when it is super intentional and depends on what your project is. Maybe consider it with generative type project, take your time, get to know the space, get your community, and then think of smart contracts.
  * Dee: alternative path — if you’re able to, you don’t have to be with what your smart contract to be forever — don’t be afraid to set up something in a quick dry run. You can be a kinesthetic learner! It’s the best place to kinesthetically learn and if it’s not primary but want to figure it out, I did this last year for Rarible, and went through that process up to the gas price, and that’s what it would be like! So I can know. I feel like that’s a great approach as well and don’t feel the pressure of having this be your one and all. Don’t be afraid to experiment. As another slightly deeper rabbit hole alternative, if you see all the available chains, you can deploy it to Rinkeby test network.
  * Check out[https://www.manifold.xyz/](https://www.manifold.xyz) or Rarible for that!
* Sassy: do you have collections or editions? I am interested!
  * Dee: has been used for PoolSuite and other projects like FWB. Been widely used and very successful for others. I want to get Jacob to do a tutorial, will ask!
  * Check out [https://github.com/ourzora/nft-editions](https://github.com/ourzora/nft-editions)!
*   SusieKav: this has been amazing! For Polygon — I’m still learning all of this. ETH is too much and expensive and was playing with [artiva.app](http://artiva.app) marketplace and mint something, and doing it live, but had it running live — and I was like, I can’t mint because it cost too much money. Person I was talking about is that they’re more of a sidechain and centralized as Polygon, so if they decide to pull ranks or \[...] what happens then?

    * Dee: I don’t have full breadth or scope. \[...] The way Polygon network works to some extent is more than central Polygon team running validators and nodes, but Polygon is on a path to progressive decentralization, where as they started centralized, but they expanded over time.
