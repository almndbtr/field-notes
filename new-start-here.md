description: Getting started with web3 crypto.

# üê£ New? Start here

If you search for "web3 crypto" in any search engine or social media platform, you'll be met with a ton of information. It can be overwhelming and often disorienting to find who to listen to versus tune out.

I got my bearing by talking to my co-workers who were more well-versed in the space and asked them for their recommendations. They shared podcasts, videos, books, and thought leaders and encouraged me to do my own research before committing any money to any one project. If you're interested in how I got into crypto, check it out on `mirror.xyz`: [How I got into crypto](https://mirror.xyz/almndbtr.eth/MytpbdZZKS-TrS5INDbwXiviYW1wAfQQ0RBmsWwD0JE).

### Personas

I learned that there are different ways to get "involved" in the crypto space. I've transitioned between [Personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona) and sometimes even wore more than one "hat" at a time. There are probably more that I will discover as I traverse the rabbit hole and I'll document them here as I become them. Maybe these lenses could help you find where you're at on your journey.

* `Spectator` : I started early 2021. I didn't want to spend any money on any cryptocurrency or related platform. Instead, I just wanted to focus on watching, reading, and learning from people I trusted. I didn't want to "buy in" or [have skin in the game](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/have+skin+in+the+game) without getting a foundational bearing.&#x20;
* `Investor`: After learning more about the space, I decided to create a wallet and buy my first cryptocurrency. I bought [Bitcoin](https://www.eli5-bitcoin.com) first. Then, I bought [Ether](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ether) and other [Altcoins](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/altcoin).
* `Developer`: I'm a source diver - I love understanding how things work by taking it apart, building it back up, and either automating or extending it. I don't know where I'd be without the open source community and decided to contribute consistently this 2022.&#x20;
* `Collector`: I collect music and art NFTs. My collection is available at [https://jemi.so/almndbtr](https://jemi.so/almndbtr). My first music NFT is [Allan Kingdom's Reasons](https://www.sound.xyz/allankingdom/reasons) as a part of [sound.xyz](https://twitter.com/soundxyz\_)'s Genesis Collection.

#### Podcasts & Videos

Listening to podcasts and watching videos helped me the most when I first started. Here are creators that left a positive impression on me.

#### Books üìñ

* Daniel Drescher's [Blockchain Basics](http://blockchain-basics.com): this accelerated my conceptual understanding of the blockchain without getting bogged down in the code.
* Eliot Couvat's [The Social Token Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Token-Revolution-revolutionize-together-ebook/dp/B09NGSZRBG): this helped me understand social tokens, the next "wave" of currency to coordinate individuals in group around a share goal. These social tokens are different from [stablecoins](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-stablecoin), altcoins, and other currencies.

#### Whitepapers

[Whitepapers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\_paper) are a guide that informs readers about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. Crypto projects often publish them to share what they bring to the space and technical specifics for how it works.&#x20;

If a new crypto project comes out and does not cite or plan to release their whitepaper(s) ahead of the initial offering, run away in the opposite direction. Be sure to read it and get ready to ask questions to the appropriate maintainers and community managers in Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or GitHub Discussions.
