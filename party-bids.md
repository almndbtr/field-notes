### Motivation 🤔

* I'm writing these as the docs I wish I had when I started
* I'm using this to track my thoughts and experiences when I open my party bid in the future

### Process 📝

* Planning a PartyBid
  * Who should be involved?
  * What do you need to know ahead of time?
* Executing a PartyBid
  * How do you communicate your PartyBid to others?
  * What is the minimum or maximum amount someone can chip in?
  * What if the party exceeds the reserve price?
  * Once a person deposits their share in escrow, can it be withdrawn?
* What happens at the end of PartyBid
  * Case: your party wins
  * Case: your party loses
