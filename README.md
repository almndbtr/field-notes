## Almond's Field Notes

### [https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev/](https://field-notes.almndbtr.dev)

Almond's Field Notes is an [open-source publication](https://github.com/almndbtr/field-notes) to track `@almndbtr`'s experiences in web3.&#x20;

It is a live and breathing journal.&#x20;

It documents Almond's understanding of the fundamentals in the space, conversations within the community, pointers to others' perspectives, and is by no means perfect. But, it's his, and he wants to share it with everyone. ♥️

@joekay's interview with Serato motivated Almond to publish it in this format:

!["Sharing the codes and breaking bread with the community." - @joekay](.gitbook/assets/sharing-the-codes-and-breaking-bread-with-the-community-joekay-almndbtr.png)

(Forgive his misplaced apostrophe. :see\_no\_evil:)

### Process 💭

* 🤔Start: when I have an idea, I'll create a new item in the [`Field Notes` project board](https://github.com/users/almndbtr/projects/1) and add any relevant labels. If I have no ideas, I'll work through my own backlog or ask my friends what they're curious about.
* 🙆‍♂️Next: when I'm ready to work on an idea, set its status to `In Progress`.
  * :grapes:In the issue, I'll spike out a list of tasks of what I want to explore.
  * :pencil2:Using Gitbook's interface, I'll just write a sloppy first draft to get it all out there (brain dump). When it's "good enough", I'll merge it in, read it in production, and find areas to iterate and work on.
* :relieved:Finish: when I think that it's gone through enough iterations after self-review and peer-review, I close out the issue with a comment.
