# üìì Almond's Field Notes

These are Almond's field notes on web3 crypto.

### Why this exists

I started this online publication to track what I'm learning and teaching it to anyone's who's curious about the space. I even tweeted about it after listening to @joekay's interview with Serato!

!["Sharing the codes and breaking bread with the community." - @joekay](.gitbook/assets/sharing-the-codes-and-breaking-bread-with-the-community-joekay-almndbtr.png)

(Forgive my misplaced apostrophe. :see\_no\_evil:)

Thanks `@joekay` and the Soulection team for encouraging folks to share the codes and break bread with the community. As a long-time listener and software engineer, I'm here for it. :man\_technologist::bread::woman\_technologist:

### Process

* ü§îStart: when I have an idea, I'll create a new item in the [`Field Notes` project board](https://github.com/users/almndbtr/projects/1) and add any relevant labels. If I have no ideas, I'll work through my own backlog or ask my friends what they're curious about.
* üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èNext: when I'm ready to work on an idea, set its status to `In Progress`.
  * :grapes:In the issue, I'll spike out a list of tasks of what I want to explore.
  * :pencil2:Using Gitbook's interface, I'll just write a sloppy first draft to get it all out there (brain dump). When it's "good enough", I'll merge it in, read it in production, and find areas to iterate and work on.
* :relieved:Finish: when I think that it's gone through enough iterations after self-review and peer-review, I close out the issue with a comment.
