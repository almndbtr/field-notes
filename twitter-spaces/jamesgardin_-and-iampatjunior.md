* Special thanks to James and Pat for making this space open to me. :sparkles:

### Notes

* NFT Basics - how do you explain this to your friends?
* Pat: What do you get, physically?&#x20;
  * It's more than just, buy my NFT - but people who have a hold of it, there is a responsibility to build that, exclusiveness of it -- to airdrop some things, to those individuals like exclusive NFTs or demos or ship your shirt, or whatever!
* James: rarity is made up. We make it up. We believe what we make up and when something is introduced, you made up the other value. We understand in some context, that it's valuable.&#x20;
* Pat: the really cool thing about web3 -- I can get with you, and say it was me you and DOM -- I produce the beat, wrote the hook, and we all collaborate on the song together. And then, we declare the worth of that song to be like, from a money perspective -- I love sharing the bag. I love working together and getting the bag together. That's just one thing and accomplishing something and everyone gets to eat. In the past, before web3, we're talking about collaborating and put it on the streaming platforms. But now, it's cool now to, work together on something and say, "we'll list this for 3ETH together." You come out on the other side of it and I like that concept better of being able with, we created something great, and we get a bigger value than pennies off of something. Or, with the music video stuff -- in instances when you have people that work together, the idea to get the value of that work where everyone is able to get paid, that's great.
* James: we should tap into more collaboration. You can just make projects bigger, do more together, and sell at a higher price. I think like, even if people who stream, there is a tier for that. Sometimes that's the support they can do. If people can afford to buy the big piece, they can appreciate it at that level. If someone has the money to do it, they buy the piece and I can use that to fund the piece.&#x20;
  * Pat: There's listening parties too.
* James: We can just be Robinhood on the blockchain and get the rich collectors to buy it.
