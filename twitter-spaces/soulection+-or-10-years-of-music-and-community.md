### Notes

// Start: began at December 16, 2021, 10:30AM PST.

* From [abjonian.eth](https://twitter.com/\_AbJo): \[...]
* From [imaneurope.eth](https://twitter.com/ImanEurope):
  * "I felt like there was a void, and that void was value."
  * [https://beta.catalog.works/imaneurope/and-so-it-s-so-](https://beta.catalog.works/imaneurope/and-so-it-s-so-)
  * "We're creating space for women, brown and black artists, but what is most important to me and stress is the community here. The way we big each other up because there is really space for all of us. There's a lot of ways in Web2 that I wasn't able to be my full self. As a black woman, you're put in a box â€” you have to rap or talk like this â€” and I'm so elemental that I cannot completely expand. Moving into Web 3, it allowed me \[...] I feel supported."
  * "As far as money goes, when I sold my Genesis NFT, at the time ETH was $4.3K â€” when I went and did the math for what a million streams would have taken me much longer. I felt like I'm finally getting my worth as a black woman, and as an artist and as a human. I'm reaping it back finally."
  * "If anyone needs help, hit me up and I will give you whatever information you need. I'm an NFT collector now which is really dope, which makes this community go. You don't just get ETH, but you spend ETH. I brought three different pieces just of my friends to get their bid started or support my friend."
* From joekay:
  * Moving the mic
* From McClenney
  * What's exciting: In web2, some of the things that happened there, don't matter in Web3. It's this kind of, democratizing opportunity so everyone gets a fair chance. Everyone here has to work here to their persona/brand.
  * Whether it was DSP, Twitter, or Instagram, there were so many people working hard but so few opportunities. Now, it is this moment where it is early and pioneering moment, where you learn and contribute to the community, you can figure out how you want to shape it.
  * DSPs have changed a lot over the years, but there's kind of a moment for everyone to win in their own way. There's so many ways and a chance to be able to take it in the direction you want it to go in.
  * Personally, for me, building a tokenized ecosystem â€” there's Ethereum network, and Binance smart chain, and all these networks â€” you can have your own token. Everyone can have that and shaped that however they want to be.
  * Last: it is important to have those interactions with those fans. And with your peers. People that you're really excited about. It takes everybody. It's not just about relationship between fans or who might be your manager or whoever it is â€” everybody here is excited about supporting each other and where the future takes us. It's an exciting time to bring the value back to the art. Even not just for the musicians but for the people such as Joe and Andre, the people who created DAOs and want to be supportive of the musicians and the artists. That's just as important. It's important for the business people that support them. It's a great time and there's so much ahead of us.
  * I have a few ideas in my mind \[for my drop] and talk to Mike and the sound people. I want to find the right thing that isn't just a song, but it has an artistic kind of edge to it. It's coming soon, for sure.
  * From Joe: Do you ever feel FOMO? Or do you spend your time researching your options?
    * Chris: For sure - early on, it's easy to feel FOMO. But you realize that, sure, there's many DAOs and organizations that are new, but at the same time, the difference between Spotify or Apple. Things move algorithmically and there's only so much space on the playlist. But now with [sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz) or Catalog â€” there's only 100 spots to look. With this, you're only really like focusing on what you're doing and making it feel authentic and this is a representation of you and you thoughtfully put this forward. You realize that what we have always wanted â€” Instagram has changed so much. It was meant to be the best version of yourself, but they started rewarding things that challenged that. If you build an ecosystem or do web3, as long as you are doing what is authentic to you, that FOMO doesn't really matter, because the people are going to be there and what \[...]
* From mrmarstoday:
  * Some of these apps are still curated to prove out the business model. It is in the best of Web3, but how does the average artist do it who don't have a direct link to Catalog or [Sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz) or any of these companies?
  * imaneurope: there are some apps that you can upload too, like [ZORA](https://zora.co) and [Opensea](http://opensea.io).
  * abjonian: You can set up on [OpenSea and use the Matic network](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012889322-How-do-I-purchase-NFTs-on-Polygon-). There's also [https://foundation.app/](https://foundation.app) â€” and Foundation is invite-only, but some of these apps have different purposes.
    * OpenSea is the most open as far as things go
    * s/o to [Latasha](https://twitter.com/CallMeLatasha)
    * Different apps for different audiences
    * We're figuring out how to use different platforms for different reasons. So you don't need to rely on one platform to get something done!
  * Mint Songs is also an option: [https://www.mintsongs.com/](https://www.mintsongs.com)
  * McClenney: In Discord, you can learn and meet other people. You're not talking to the devs per se, but other people who are interested who want to find out how to mint. Jump in the Discords and just try to learn. It really makes a difference.
    * Abjo: Discord is one of the most efficient tools for learning. People are going to come as a cross-path that's happening on all Discords.
    * Joe Kay: I've been hopping into a lot of different Discords to see how people structure their communities. Even, pre- and being in Kenny Beats' Discord and the \[many] members and streaming the way he did. Now we have Monty Booker and seeing how he has integrated his community. There's this whole conversation of things and focusing on the music side. No matter what medium, you can see people just building things out (cites example from The Hundreds â€” [https://abs.thehundreds.com/](https://abs.thehundreds.com))
      * As far as Soulection is concerned, we want to drop NFTs and onboarding to Discord and getting their wallet addresses and being able to airdrop them. Giving them free NFTs so they're not left out. The Hundreds is someone to watch, and Street Dreams Cafe [https://streetdreamscafe.com/](https://streetdreamscafe.com)).
      * There's a collector out there that wants to collect your "fine art", so s/o to Street Dreams Cafe
      * Whether you are a visual artist, photographer, or creative, there's a space for you!
      * He dropped 5000 Hoodlums and it sold out in a day. He made 600 grand. He created a new infrastructure.
      * We're working on building developers and engineers on Soulection. As they design and code and they're listening, we're getting in contact with the top people in the space. It's amazing. It stems from speaking out in person and I thought it was important to share these codes and these stories.
      * This is Phase 1. We're experimenting. Everyone in this chat is early adopters and willing to share in this experiment.
* From howyouspellthat
  * It's people who will pull up are real fans, more than collectors
  * Make it clear: we need you all in this space and you all interacting with the offerings that are coming out. You don't need to spend 1ETH just to get involved.
* From mrmarstoday
  * It's amazing to get all the artists experimenting. Unlike the gated web2 infra, all the apps in the space want you to play around.
  * Catalog is for 1
  * [sound.xyz](http://sound.xyz) is pushing the multiples and the pre-sales
  * mintsongs is for everyone to do polygon NFTs and do 100 free NFTs
  * everyone is driving to the same point â€” the real power is connecting to the fans on a deeper level. It's for connecting with them with a specific NFT â€” there's a million ways to play. \[...] There's different ways to play with it, even with a community based perspective.
* From imaneurope
  * It's a more intimate relationship with your fans.
  * When someone buys your piece for 1ETH, we're friends forever.
  * I want to make sure you and I leave a mark. When I released my first NFT, I sent Matthew a hand-written note, lyrics to the song, framed and since it was about affirmation, I sent him an affirmation book as well.
  * We keep in contact through the internet and to echo what everyone is saying, it helps build a deeper bond in the community.
* Trackademics.eth
  * Piggybacking from iman's point: you can really set the intention for how you interact with your fans in the space.
  * Different folks who can come together and really create something special â€” the things that you can do with Web3 is so amazing, and it doesn't have to be 2D. You can augment your creativity.
  * HELP PEOPLE ONBOARD TO THE SPACE.
* HALEEK MAUL
  * I appreciate and embody that. Supporting these things â€” thank you for putting up my catalog in this space. I came in kind of late, and Iman posted this Twitter Space and wanted to say thank you.
  * From joekay: I've been using you as a poster child to get into your community into this, and I've been seeing for the backend, what it takes to put out a single, EP, and album, and those budgets â€” but we've been able to move things with 10K-30K USD and what you do with Catalog and Mirror account is inspiring. Seeing how you've broken down things. I have one of the tweets on royalty share. Artists breaking bread or points in royalty.
  * Haleek: the token â€” my social token â€” it is part of the world we're building. NFTs and DeFi and the things that make crypto and blockchain tech work, was going to really take musicians to another level. I understand the business behind it too, to a certain level, that empowers me to a certain place. This really elevated my experience in the art and being able to actually work with my features 1-1 with no intermediary, and being able to befriend these people and have this relationship â€” this is not for clout, but stuff happening organically as an artist and to do that and be able to build my business and specific to where I am from. I am in Barbados right now, and built most of my life here, and it's always been a thing to go to US â€” but I founded @holdersland and we're making the albums for the cost of electricity. I'm putting this out in front of everyone and people building and bidding on these NFTs. We are working on this by using MUSIC AS A PRIMITIVE. I'm getting people to understand the approach we're trying to take with it. It really takes the pressure off from the artist without compromising the art itself. That's what I like about this stuff.
  * From joekay: building the studios from this work in Barbados â€” that's \[...] â€” everyone has bills and leases and mortgages to pay. Giving back to the community and it's important to give back as we're receiving.
* From joeykay: SQUARE ZERO
  * Everyone in web3 understands the protocols in terms of environmental things, but people wonder why is Soulection doing this? Is there anyone that can tackle that real quick?
    * From Haleek: I saw some metrics on this. I'm not an expert. For people who complain environmental implications from BTC or ETH, I know they're planning to move to proof-of-stake, which should lower emissions a bit. But, even if you compare it to CO2 producing industries, this is not nearly as bad as the other things going on in this planet. We also need to think about what this is doing for alot of people disadvantaged in this world. We can take this money and streamline and speed up environmental efforts like planting trees and education and advocacy. There's a lot of people trying to offset carbon emissions from sales, but it's not as bad as people think it is.
    * If you're an NFT artist, and you can help with this kind of stuff, look into the options that exist in terms of reducing carbon emissions, but I don't think that's really "our problem", per se, but there's a bunch of other stuff.
    * Joe: We can get into the details of people who are, "what is your fuel consumption? electricity, flying, cars, etc.?" You can go down the list and you have to live a very - off-the-grid life if you want to protect this. But in the world we live in, it's not realistic.
* Anil Lulla: there's so much being built out here, even concerns that are rooted in some type of truth, are not going to matter 12-16 months from now. For Delphi Digital, we're invested in massive scale NFT minting, which is carbon neutral. We helped to introduce them to Tik Tok, but they still got backlash from loud minority that doesn't understand. They might be intimidated by what's going on here. Anyone listening to this is already past that, and is mostly just focused on the potential. I've been listening for a little bit, and Joe was nice enough to invite me, but I've collected some of the work from a bunch of people, and HALEEK is a grinder obviously, but some that I've heard from some artists on Catalog, Audius, or Foundation and I want to catch up. All of you bring such unique perspectives, and it makes me bullish on crypto. This year was a shift in the industry for CULTURE ON CHAIN. There's numbers for what sounds conceivable. Think through the space and talking to Joe and the Soulection team â€” now is the time to start and f\*\*\* around. The developers need feedback so how they can make it better for you. Anyone listening and speaking and taking notes here, we're all going to make it. It's all beginning stages.
  * From McClenney: as Anil just said â€” we're still early in this. What's really exciting personally is diving into DeFi. There's a wealth transfer, where people like us, there's opportunities to generate wealth. When you look at the cultural piece of NFTs and DeFi, it's going to help create more opportunities for people. There's DAOs like CLIMA (see [https://daocentral.com/](https://daocentral.com) for more details) and that's such an important part to be aware as creators and cultural people. It creates opportunities for people here. Slightly tangential, but \[...]
* Gap: 11:28AM - 11:32AM PST
* From Joe: it's a norm to hear the influence and in the future beats category â€” it's become such a norm. It's been so amazing to see and testament to the legacy that we built. Monty Booker is who we plan to drop our first release with. Sango has been in the discussion as well, something from one of his albums (like North â€” [https://soulection.bandcamp.com/album/north](https://soulection.bandcamp.com/album/north)). \[...] It's crazy how things have shifted. We've gone from tapes to CDs and Myspace Music and Napster and some of our cars don't even have CDs, but you can save music from DSPs online. Everything is so digital now. It's been dope to watch the different mediums and excited to see what we can do with our Marquee Artists and if anyone in Soulection is curious, we created an onboarding session the other day. I don't know too many labels who are trying to education, champion, and inform, and enlighten. We are here to be of service to our people and to our artists.
* Stay tuned for Monty Booker and Sango.
* We've been working with our visual artists and breaking bread with them.
