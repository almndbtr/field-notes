### Notes

* Listening Party
  * James Gardin - Damage
* Introductions
  * Pat Junior, James Gardin, Almond
* Artist Meet & Greet
  * Pat | What we want to do: we ourselves, are artists, producers. Pat does sound design, and James is a teacher of sorts. We want to create a space for artists who are already in Web3 and those interested in the Web3 space. James reached out to me and said I thought I would kill it in this space, and we want to share the knowledge we have, and we want to share. We don't know everything, but we want to share the knowledge we have with the blockchain and web3, but want to create a space and community so we can all learn fvrom each other. From time to time, we will have think tanks. What we're doing today: we are having an artist meet and greet.  We have rules and guidelines. Feel free to request to come up and speak, but I'ma let James take over to share rules for tonight.
  * James | I'm a teaching artist. We teach production and songwriting. I think the rules, sometimes help us, be more focused in conversation. I saw some spaces that went out of hand.
    * Rule #1: One voice at a time. We have no reservations to put people back in audience if they talk over people.
    * Rule #2: This is a no-shilling zone. Don't try to sell me or anyone in this room. I'd love to know your story, and share it in a more genuine way.
    * Rule #3: Keep it in the middle. Do not attack people. Evaluate ideas and concepts, but do not attack people.
    * Rule #4: Step out, but step back. If you're not on stage, you can request. But make space.
    * Rule #5: Share the room. If you get something of value out of it, share. We want to keep this as diverse as possible. If we have women raising their hand, fellas, please feel free to head out and we don't want to make this feel like a boys club.&#x20;
    * Rule #6: We will enforce these rules.
  * Pat | Share the space on your timeline. Share the wealth. We are not trying to promote ourselves. We want to share community and bring awareness. There are artists in Web2 that I think, would kill in Web3. We want to share the wealth with talented artists who feel like, we want them to do well. Share the space, let's let folks up.
