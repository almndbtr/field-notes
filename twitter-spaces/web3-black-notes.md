### Notes

* Listening Party
  * James Gardin - Damage
* Introductions
  * Pat Junior, James Gardin, Almond
* Artist Meet & Greet
  * Pat | What we want to do: we ourselves, are artists, producers. Pat does sound design, and James is a teacher of sorts. We want to create a space for artists who are already in Web3 and those interested in the Web3 space. James reached out to me and said I thought I would kill it in this space, and we want to share the knowledge we have, and we want to share. We don't know everything, but we want to share the knowledge we have with the blockchain and web3, but want to create a space and community so we can all learn fvrom each other. From time to time, we will have think tanks. What we're doing today: we are having an artist meet and greet.  We have rules and guidelines. Feel free to request to come up and speak, but I'ma let James take over to share rules for tonight.
  * James | I'm a teaching artist. We teach production and songwriting. I think the rules, sometimes help us, be more focused in conversation. I saw some spaces that went out of hand.
    * Rule #1: One voice at a time. We have no reservations to put people back in audience if they talk over people.
    * Rule #2: This is a no-shilling zone. Don't try to sell me or anyone in this room. I'd love to know your story, and share it in a more genuine way.
    * Rule #3: Keep it in the middle. Do not attack people. Evaluate ideas and concepts, but do not attack people.
    * Rule #4: Step out, but step back. If you're not on stage, you can request. But make space.
    * Rule #5: Share the room. If you get something of value out of it, share. We want to keep this as diverse as possible. If we have women raising their hand, fellas, please feel free to head out and we don't want to make this feel like a boys club.&#x20;
    * Rule #6: We will enforce these rules.
  * Pat | Share the space on your timeline. Share the wealth. We are not trying to promote ourselves. We want to share community and bring awareness. There are artists in Web2 that I think, would kill in Web3. We want to share the wealth with talented artists who feel like, we want them to do well. Share the space, let's let folks up.
  * caleb777 | shout-out to Pat and James. Appreciate ya'll. Just wanted to hop in and say what's good. I always want to make myself known, even if there are familiar people. I see you Thomas. James, is the homie. I've been knowing James for a couple of years, meeting you at a KB concert. I'm an artist, experimental -- a lot of hip hop inspired stuff, but I also do lo-fi stuff and boom-bap. Some heavier stuff, some trap metal sh\*\* -- I came up with the OG SoundCloud scene, and Denzel Curry and Odd Future. As far as Web3, I've been in this space for over a month and I'm just, in love with the community and emphasis on community as well. From Web2, even being in spaces like this, it's difficult for me because in places like Instagram and TikTok, it is Clout Based. Already, being in these spaces, I'm in rooms with Sunny Digital and Allan Kingdom. I've been on Allan Kingdom since 2013-14 and it's wild how technology grows and I'm super inspired and excited about it and I love the stuff we talk about, especially with Tika and SassyBlack and abundance mindset. Everyone grows together and comes up together. I'm all about giving back and just community. That's me. I appreciate ya'll.
    * James: What's something new you learned recently about Web3 that you didn't know would be valuable?
      * caleb777: for me, going back to something I said before. One of the biggest things is that it's not about klout. I really felt like that on other platforms (Instagram) -- I don't know a certain person or someone's camp, so there's no way that I can speak with these people. For me, just showing up, we talk alot about that, but just showing up, I learn that it is beneficial. Pull up to these spaces, and get to know people's stories. Don't shill and sell nothing. Be genuine and authentic and everything else. Support gon' come. Be genuine.&#x20;
      * James: Solid. Thank you. Hopping over to Genesis.
  * Genesis | Pat Junior -- I was looking at the grill and crazy color on your face. Wait, you're in Raleigh?
    * Pat: Aquarius
    * Genesis: I'm a Pisces. I have to see what this emperor is all about. That's why I'm here. I'm Art for short. I changed to Genesis because I'm minting my first NFT next week. I'm a creative entrepreneur that paint, model, sculpt. I do things that are creative and makes me happy. I like making money. I like giving money away and it's a blessing. I'm coming out with an album in August 2022.
    * Pat: If I can ask -- can you share about what you're minting? Definitely interested. Appreciate the compliment.
      * Genesis: I would love to get a matching grill set photo with you.&#x20;
      * Pat: send it to me about the person in Brooklyn. Bet.
      * Pat: If James, if it's cool - what are you minting?
        * Genesis: I got invited to foundation. I chose the 21st because my sister is a photographer and I am minting that. My sister is on hiatus from social media but she is designing UX design and she is an Aquarius. She is working hard and this UX stuff -- I want to give her a chunk of change so she can breathe a little bit. I want her to know this NFT thing -- she has to get in. When I give her some coins, I want to get her to raise an eyebrow. Because she is on hiatus, I am adding her, and she has no clue. Whenever I make, it will be humungous.&#x20;
        * James: If you do a space for drop party, I'll pull up and support.
        * Art: I do spaces every Wednesday. I'll do a drop party day of.
    * Pat: totally down to pull up.&#x20;
      * Art: the woman can do anything; it doesn't matter.&#x20;
    * Pat: I think Dnyce was next?
  * DnycexDesign.eth: I wanted to jump in and show love. I love what you guys are doing. This pairing is a dope mix.  This is really fly. I got company, but just wanted to jump in, say love what you're doing, I was listening to Godly (Pat), but there's something about this I really like. It's because -- do you know Taylor Grey? That first verse in Godly, just reminds me of Taylor. And, he's like one of my favorites. You definitely got something that's really special and follow your growth cuz you definitely got the sauce.
    * Pat: Appreciate you.
    * James: s/o Pat for having the sauce.
  * Scolla: Peace bro, peace. I didn't want to say much -- I saw you post earlier James. You've always been part of things in honest space. Tyler Donovan has worked with you before and got me hipped on Gold Fangs on Sunday. I f\* **** with Godly heavy. It's gold's ear. Super dope project all the way around. New to the web3 space, but just appreciate being around people that understand community and beautiful energy and creating a space where we can exist. I know James' grind and similar to mine: we've been independent artists for quite some time, and getting into web3, is being able to get these communities and families we built and really take control of our art and speak directly to the people that give a f\*\*\* to what we're doing. We want to speak to people who care. I want to do with people that take the time and give a f\*\*\*. I want to co-exist in a space to see black and brown people, men and women in the space. Love and light to ya'll. I have a project I want to mint, but anything I can learn, I'm soaking in.
    * Pat: thank you. Towards the end James, this is off-the-cuff -- it would be good to have a small section for people to get into web3 with some questions. That would be dope.
  * Chakkra Tara: I want to say -- thank you for hosting this space. Grateful for ya'll. I've been a multitude of spaces these past couple of days and it's been enriching that understand the importance of community and camaraderie and showing up for each other, especially at a time when artists are breaking barriers pushing the envelope to set the tone to say: I don't need all these factors on the backend to do what I'm doing. I can do this with my core people and it's been beautiful being in these spaces. I'm an artist, producer, and engineer. I want to show love to my brother Pat for being able to put a project last year and Pat gave me good graces to produce a record on there, and that year showed me a lot about collaboration, especially as an artist that experienced partnership taking advantage of your art -- not giving you credit or taking bread from you or not showing you love from success stories. James, I definitely appreciate the knowledge you drop on in each space.
    * I would say that my biggest takeaway from being in these spaces, like Iman dropping an NFT and multiple NFTs, like Allan dropped an NFT and multiple people -- MoRuf, for year I've been listening, and seeing the success of some of the people like Latasha, that for me, didn't get the love on certain levels. Now they're taking charge and holding it down independently. They really are full-throttle web3. What I learned from these is to get into the rooms is more important than listening to people who are saying it's a scam or doing stuff for klout. Talking to other homies, they say "I don't know about that" and when you take out of your comfort zone and the money does come to you to a certain degree, but like, the relationships that people have built from the NFTs they built and minted and blockchains -- depending on where they put their art on -- it's wow, it's crazy. This isn't just about let's drop something and get these people pumped up for like,  a cash grab moment, but we're building a community of people who care and just made multiple connections with people. Where you're at right now is more important than just someone dropping53 NFTs -- but nah bro, you're good. Your chapter 1, 1.5, 2, in this space. People are just now pouring into this. Take the time, do due diligence, and show love. God will pour back into the spaces you're showing love to.&#x20;
      * There's nothing you can do without community.
  * James: drop some ETH in the offering basket. ♥️
  * Pat: Iman is incredible. I've gotten to know her from afar, watching her journey in web2. When we say web2, we say like, DSP like spotify and everything that is not NFT in the web3 space like minting on the blockchain. Your Spotify, Tidals, etc etc. The music industry as we know it. I've been able to watch Iman from afar, and she will share some of her journey in the tweets. And, the disappointments she's faced. Aside from Twitter, I've gotten to know people that knew her, and the people that I know that know hertoo, said nothing but great things. It's unfortunate when we see in the industry that people are authentic and real and genuine who love people who are respectable in character struggle because of not stepping on people. To see her -- Iman has had some great wins in web2 and kill it in web3, has been super inspiring. She's about to get her artists back and it's going to be even better. She's been building community over here \[web3] -- I'm super proud of her. There's other people like BLACKDAVE.eth, CARLA, who is minting soon, and something super fire. Follow CARLA please. Bro, when I tell you, it's been a blessing to connect with these people in web3 space, I've met some really cool people. Everything you saying, is what it looks like. You'll run into some assholes in this space, but most folks I've run into have been great.
  * Let's get over to PHLOTE. And play a snippet of something that is currently on blockchain that we might know.
* PHLOTE: shout-out -- had to come through and support consistently James and Pat and showed up at live votes. I see you a part of it.
  * To add my 2 cents: what I have learned being deep in web2 in the blog world and coming into this world, and I see there are elements from both sides \[web2, web3] from what they are calling web3. At core of it, it's still developing community like you always have web3. We did a release with Glass and artists, but the difference that's biggest is that these protocols and companies are now, they have to be transparent in this space. Creatives and DAOs existing in this space, they have to be transparent. Otherwise, we get them out of the paint. There's levels of accountability that are existing now and saying that I say this: alot of these companies focus on scaling curation. Scaling curation is going to get a lot of the gatekeeper shenanigans out of here. We need to hold a lot of these web3 companies accountable. That's why I'm starting to get away from web2 and web3 differentiation, because the people who are developing in the community in the real world can use the tools. But, if the music doesn't hit with the crowd or community, you see investors buy it up but let's say -- I make 100 grand and I sell a bunch of NFTs but only sell to 8 people. Now when I do a show in your city, is it those 8 people? We need to do alternatives to what exists. But we need to hold platforms to hold them to a certain degree.
* Break: Bronxland and Rocky Sneider...

#### Part 2

* Gulches\_: Got introduced to Pat from another friend. I really like your music, will check James out too. Will check out this glassxyz platform too. I want to dig into that a bit. I've been in the NFT space for 8 months, and been a musician for years now. Been doing 10-20 albums engineering wise in my local area. I've been doing some modular synth -- I'm separating myself and people are getting into it with this. I love analog tech, and tryna leverage the futuristic vibe of web3 and metaverse with modular synthesizers. That is what my creative vision is heading towards right now.&#x20;
  * Been checking out Ethereum, but gas is expensive. I've been checking out Tezos for music and visual artists, and been minting mainly on there because there's very low gas fees. It's basically free to sell and auction capabilities. Been a huge fan for Tezos and other platforms, but Ethereum is expensive, but not everyone can dip into that as we wish we could. I'm excited to checkout Glass.
  * James: I will check that out and try again.
  * Pat: for modular synth, I'm a sound designer. Young's -- we will talk about everything inside and outside of music, but it gets dangerous. My exp with modular synth is very slim, BUT I have seen it in action. \[] is a modular synth and used it on my 2019 album, I Thought I Knew, bc there's another space going on with a feature going on that used it on Peace, with me and Chad. Modular Synth looks really hard to learn, but when you get locked in, -- the thing for those who don't know, you need to feed sound in the MS and use it to morph the sound and resample it or whatever the case is. It's really cool, and we can talk about that stuff another time.
  * Gulches\_: it's wires connected, you can add a keyboard and make it do whatever you want to do. There's a zillion things that you can do with it. It's everything!
* SoloSam: 2 part question
  * Confusion: a lot of people talk about freedom. Eliminate middleman in the process. It seems like, I'm just confused -- are there platforms that are in-between? When I think of that, I think of OnlyFans or Patreon, but it's still confusing me about why people are so easily available to go through this financial system to go through artists, when they could have paid artists before like individual fans/supporters? Where did these people start having this money to transfer through ethereum and not just like, pay the artist?&#x20;
    * James: \[restates question] -- I think, and I may not be the best and don't quote me, what I speculate is about what the technology can do. With OnlyFans or Patreon, and that site goes down, and you lose the connection to them, I think about -- I had, when I had 14K followers on MySpace, but it ended and I had to hop to something else, I just lost that. When we live on the blockchain, I can go on Etherscan and always have that connection with them.
      * It's with the technology you can build on other things and you don't have a platform that controls what you can do. We've had the tech, but we haven't used it in this way to show ownership in this way and we sometimes get confused to get digital stuff for free, but that's neither here nor there. The reason why people are so into this, because I also believe that the technology and NFTs will be something that integrates in everyday life. We're showing through art and entertainment, and it can be applicable to so many different things. But the tech is why people are excited. I coulda agree and see they can buy the Patreon, but you can really have the connect with the audience.
  * In that stemming away from financial instittution: my only concern is that I believe in web3. People didn't believe in dotcom bubble, but even in dotcom space, there's caveats with online space and I do like cutting the financial institutions out of the way. For you to be truly secure, you have to put systems in place that you at some point, that like losing a code or password locks you out of that. When we eliminate institutions, we can't call somebody. It's really on us. I'm an adult man, and should be responsible for my own stuff, but not gonna lie - I use these computers and these things just break. I don't want to have a broke computer. Now it's like, I can't replace the damn computer that broke. I truly believe in the system and any system of progression or any infra -- upgraded, it comes with caveats and preventative measures. What do we do to protect artists and intention? I've already seen Budweiser in it, but when I see people like that in the mix, it scares me because capitalism is going to come into this and I will turn off my mic but appreciate you.
    * Pat: If you want to learn more about web3, please share this on the timeline. We want to share the wealth and knowledge and please share this space. It's not about me and James - we want to build community and educate people as much as possible. I'll add to that: we want to help some artists with some freedom. That's a part of it too, gaining financial freedom with their art.
      * SoloSam: the way crypto started, I invested money in companies that got hit, I'm at a good place and taking profits from there and putting in. As a joke, a minute ago, there was SHIB coin and I threw some decent amount into it around like February and I wanted to pay attention to this because there's something here that's not just money that people like in Reddit space and stocks. What Reddit did to stock market was impressive, and I followed it to a tee.&#x20;
    * Pat: Do you have a Metamask wallet?
      * So, this is going to sound super silly: there was a time at the start...
      * Sam: I have one, but I don't remember the password. That's scary if they don't remember!
      * Pat: let's talk about it. From my understanding, James and Almond chime in here, from what I understand, there is no customer service. If you lose your password, it's gone. You will have to have some kind of main wallet or exchange. When you get into web3, and have metamask wallet, you need to write down that password, and you need to write down that phrase. If you get locked out, you can put that phrase in. Set up on Google Chrome. I want to see the whole screen. I don't want to make mistakes. I'll say, for sure, write it down and people say -- I wouldn't do this or advise, but some people type it in notes. IF you have a note app, type that in there and screenshot it. I have it written down.
* JPReynolds: I don't work for a crypto company, but checkout [https://createsafe.io/our-mission](https://createsafe.io/our-mission) -- having a shared wallet, there's platforms that are merging that solves the web2/web3 bridge, that is something to look out for. Just wanted to add that in there.
* CHARM TAYLOR: I resonated with what Pat and SoloSam had shared --&#x20;
  * Pat: When the ladies come in, you can be upset at me and James, it will be a wildcard Uno and they get the SKIP!&#x20;
  * CHARM TAYLOR: This is the ladies night that never ended. One of the things that I heard from SoloSam was the way you presented: like, of course you have to pay for my music! When did this mindset shift happen? When did artists value this being a debate? So much value has saved my life. Tupac was my daddy lowkey. Real life experiences was like this was for'real! If it wasn't certain voices -- Tupac wasn't doing free shows. There's that, and coming into this space and learning about NFTs about a month ago. I was activating an installation in New Orleans -- where I am based -- working with a sister of mine for people for public art and doing an art installation and building apothecaries and sonic site apothecaries that art and music is medicine -- there were live flips and experiences and Monica was projecting flipping this stuff live and murals were generative flips of my album cover. I asked what an NFT and here we are - a month ago. In this space and Twitter Spaces, this was the room that resonated with SoloSam and what James shared -- disrupting this relationship with people and it is a mindset shift. Some of the platforms are also kind of re-perpetuating this in web3, like the harmful ways from web2, and some are actually riding for artists. If I crowdfund my stuff, you still have these curational teams and people with big budgets and always want cool artists to come in and make it cool and not bust up no coin! I think one of the demands of web3 that we offer here is, everybody gotta pay. Not just consumer or some superfan or customer base, but everyone is paying. The agents and art directors are paying, and that to me is like, I want to see solidarity on that. First NFT we drop - we burst a couple of days ago. It's first of the MetaMatriarchs and the Crown Matriarchs talks about prosperity as a whole birthright of ours and ETH and tokens representing that and what they starved for so long. I want to drop it in a way that everyone can afford it, but the first one is the embodiment is what I know for over the course of my career to have maternity leave and having music licenses and investors who want the NFT itself and having a remix from She's The Future (one of my albums) and a sync license like someone who knows what to do with a WAV file, but you have a master use to use the song and video and live performance and kicking off the NFT tour, and it came -- I think that's it. We're performing in ETH Denver!
* Monica Rose: check out the foundation.app listing and monitherose.eth
  * Know of any DAOs to help us bridge the gap in funding, but we can bring our DJ and priestess squad to build the altar? I want to bring our team to Denver. We have the ability to accept 51 different tokens. If you want to donate given tax time, you can change to fiat and tax, or donate it to us in crypto first and not get taxed. Check out my last tweet
* \[EDITOR NOTE] Almond dropped from the space at 8:56PM EST. These are incomplete notes.
