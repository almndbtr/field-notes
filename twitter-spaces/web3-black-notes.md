### Notes

* Listening Party
  * James Gardin - Damage
* Introductions
  * Pat Junior, James Gardin, Almond
* Artist Meet & Greet
  * Pat | What we want to do: we ourselves, are artists, producers. Pat does sound design, and James is a teacher of sorts. We want to create a space for artists who are already in Web3 and those interested in the Web3 space. James reached out to me and said I thought I would kill it in this space, and we want to share the knowledge we have, and we want to share. We don't know everything, but we want to share the knowledge we have with the blockchain and web3, but want to create a space and community so we can all learn fvrom each other. From time to time, we will have think tanks. What we're doing today: we are having an artist meet and greet.  We have rules and guidelines. Feel free to request to come up and speak, but I'ma let James take over to share rules for tonight.
  * James | I'm a teaching artist. We teach production and songwriting. I think the rules, sometimes help us, be more focused in conversation. I saw some spaces that went out of hand.
    * Rule #1: One voice at a time. We have no reservations to put people back in audience if they talk over people.
    * Rule #2: This is a no-shilling zone. Don't try to sell me or anyone in this room. I'd love to know your story, and share it in a more genuine way.
    * Rule #3: Keep it in the middle. Do not attack people. Evaluate ideas and concepts, but do not attack people.
    * Rule #4: Step out, but step back. If you're not on stage, you can request. But make space.
    * Rule #5: Share the room. If you get something of value out of it, share. We want to keep this as diverse as possible. If we have women raising their hand, fellas, please feel free to head out and we don't want to make this feel like a boys club.&#x20;
    * Rule #6: We will enforce these rules.
  * Pat | Share the space on your timeline. Share the wealth. We are not trying to promote ourselves. We want to share community and bring awareness. There are artists in Web2 that I think, would kill in Web3. We want to share the wealth with talented artists who feel like, we want them to do well. Share the space, let's let folks up.
  * caleb777 | shout-out to Pat and James. Appreciate ya'll. Just wanted to hop in and say what's good. I always want to make myself known, even if there are familiar people. I see you Thomas. James, is the homie. I've been knowing James for a couple of years, meeting you at a KB concert. I'm an artist, experimental -- a lot of hip hop inspired stuff, but I also do lo-fi stuff and boom-bap. Some heavier stuff, some trap metal sh\*\* -- I came up with the OG SoundCloud scene, and Denzel Curry and Odd Future. As far as Web3, I've been in this space for over a month and I'm just, in love with the community and emphasis on community as well. From Web2, even being in spaces like this, it's difficult for me because in places like Instagram and TikTok, it is Clout Based. Already, being in these spaces, I'm in rooms with Sunny Digital and Allan Kingdom. I've been on Allan Kingdom since 2013-14 and it's wild how technology grows and I'm super inspired and excited about it and I love the stuff we talk about, especially with Tika and SassyBlack and abundance mindset. Everyone grows together and comes up together. I'm all about giving back and just community. That's me. I appreciate ya'll.
    * James: What's something new you learned recently about Web3 that you didn't know would be valuable?
      * caleb777: for me, going back to something I said before. One of the biggest things is that it's not about klout. I really felt like that on other platforms (Instagram) -- I don't know a certain person or someone's camp, so there's no way that I can speak with these people. For me, just showing up, we talk alot about that, but just showing up, I learn that it is beneficial. Pull up to these spaces, and get to know people's stories. Don't shill and sell nothing. Be genuine and authentic and everything else. Support gon' come. Be genuine.&#x20;
      * James: Solid. Thank you. Hopping over to Genesis.
  * Genesis | Pat Junior -- I was looking at the grill and crazy color on your face. Wait, you're in Raleigh?
    * Pat: Aquarius
    * Genesis: I'm a Pisces. I have to see what this emperor is all about. That's why I'm here. I'm Art for short. I changed to Genesis because I'm minting my first NFT next week. I'm a creative entrepreneur that paint, model, sculpt. I do things that are creative and makes me happy. I like making money. I like giving money away and it's a blessing. I'm coming out with an album in August 2022.
    * Pat: If I can ask -- can you share about what you're minting? Definitely interested. Appreciate the compliment.
      * Genesis: I would love to get a matching grill set photo with you.&#x20;
      * Pat: send it to me about the person in Brooklyn. Bet.
      * Pat: If James, if it's cool - what are you minting?
        * Genesis: I got invited to foundation. I chose the 21st because my sister is a photographer and I am minting that. My sister is on hiatus from social media but she is designing UX design and she is an Aquarius. She is working hard and this UX stuff -- I want to give her a chunk of change so she can breathe a little bit. I want her to know this NFT thing -- she has to get in. When I give her some coins, I want to get her to raise an eyebrow. Because she is on hiatus, I am adding her, and she has no clue. Whenever I make, it will be humungous.&#x20;
        * James: If you do a space for drop party, I'll pull up and support.
        * Art: I do spaces every Wednesday. I'll do a drop party day of.
    * Pat: totally down to pull up.&#x20;
      * Art: the woman can do anything; it doesn't matter.&#x20;
    * Pat: I think Dnyce was next?
  * DnycexDesign.eth: I wanted to jump in and show love. I love what you guys are doing. This pairing is a dope mix.  This is really fly. I got company, but just wanted to jump in, say love what you're doing, I was listening to Godly (Pat), but there's something about this I really like. It's because -- do you know Taylor Grey? That first verse in Godly, just reminds me of Taylor. And, he's like one of my favorites. You definitely got something that's really special and follow your growth cuz you definitely got the sauce.
    * Pat: Appreciate you.
    * James: s/o Pat for having the sauce.
  * Scolla: Peace bro, peace. I didn't want to say much -- I saw you post earlier James. You've always been part of things in honest space. Tyler Donovan has worked with you before and got me hipped on Gold Fangs on Sunday. I f\* **** with Godly heavy. It's gold's ear. Super dope project all the way around. New to the web3 space, but just appreciate being around people that understand community and beautiful energy and creating a space where we can exist. I know James' grind and similar to mine: we've been independent artists for quite some time, and getting into web3, is being able to get these communities and families we built and really take control of our art and speak directly to the people that give a f\*\*\* to what we're doing. We want to speak to people who care. I want to do with people that take the time and give a f\*\*\*. I want to co-exist in a space to see black and brown people, men and women in the space. Love and light to ya'll. I have a project I want to mint, but anything I can learn, I'm soaking in.
    * Pat: thank you. Towards the end James, this is off-the-cuff -- it would be good to have a small section for people to get into web3 with some questions. That would be dope.
  * Chakkra Tara: I want to say -- thank you for hosting this space. Grateful for ya'll. I've been a multitude of spaces these past couple of days and it's been enriching that understand the importance of community and camaraderie and showing up for each other, especially at a time when artists are breaking barriers pushing the envelope to set the tone to say: I don't need all these factors on the backend to do what I'm doing. I can do this with my core people and it's been beautiful being in these spaces. I'm an artist, producer, and engineer. I want to show love to my brother Pat for being able to put a project last year and Pat gave me good graces to produce a record on there, and that year showed me a lot about collaboration, especially as an artist that experienced partnership taking advantage of your art -- not giving you credit or taking bread from you or not showing you love from success stories. James, I definitely appreciate the knowledge you drop on in each space.
    * I would say that my biggest takeaway from being in these spaces, like Iman dropping an NFT and multiple NFTs, like Allan dropped an NFT and multiple people -- MoRuf, for year I've been listening, and seeing the success of some of the people like Latasha, that for me, didn't get the love on certain levels. Now they're taking charge and holding it down independently. They really are full-throttle web3. What I learned from these is to get into the rooms is more important than listening to people who are saying it's a scam or doing stuff for klout. Talking to other homies, they say "I don't know about that" and when you take out of your comfort zone and the money does come to you to a certain degree, but like, the relationships that people have built from the NFTs they built and minted and blockchains -- depending on where they put their art on -- it's wow, it's crazy. This isn't just about let's drop something and get these people pumped up for like,  a cash grab moment, but we're building a community of people who care and just made multiple connections with people. Where you're at right now is more important than just someone dropping53 NFTs -- but nah bro, you're good. Your chapter 1, 1.5, 2, in this space. People are just now pouring into this. Take the time, do due diligence, and show love. God will pour back into the spaces you're showing love to.&#x20;
      * There's nothing you can do without community.
  * James: drop some ETH in the offering basket. ♥️
  * Pat: Iman is incredible. I've gotten to know her from afar, watching her journey in web2. When we say web2, we say like, DSP like spotify and everything that is not NFT in the web3 space like minting on the blockchain. Your Spotify, Tidals, etc etc. The music industry as we know it. I've been able to watch Iman from afar, and she will share some of her journey in the tweets. And, the disappointments she's faced. Aside from Twitter, I've gotten to know people that knew her, and the people that I know that know hertoo, said nothing but great things. It's unfortunate when we see in the industry that people are authentic and real and genuine who love people who are respectable in character struggle because of not stepping on people. To see her -- Iman has had some great wins in web2 and kill it in web3, has been super inspiring. She's about to get her artists back and it's going to be even better. She's been building community over here \[web3] -- I'm super proud of her. There's other people like BLACKDAVE.eth, CARLA, who is minting soon, and something super fire. Follow CARLA please. Bro, when I tell you, it's been a blessing to connect with these people in web3 space, I've met some really cool people. Everything you saying, is what it looks like. You'll run into some assholes in this space, but most folks I've run into have been great.
  * Let's get over to PHLOTE. And play a snippet of something that is currently on blockchain that we might know.
* PHLOTE: shout-out -- had to come through and support consistently James and Pat and showed up at live votes. I see you a part of it.
  * To add my 2 cents: what I have learned being deep in web2 in the blog world and coming into this world, and I see there are elements from both sides \[web2, web3] from what they are calling web3. At core of it, it's still developing community like you always have web3. We did a release with Glass and artists, but the difference that's biggest is that these protocols and companies are now, they have to be transparent in this space. Creatives and DAOs existing in this space, they have to be transparent. Otherwise, we get them out of the paint. There's levels of accountability that are existing now and saying that I say this: alot of these companies focus on scaling curation. Scaling curation is going to get a lot of the gatekeeper shenanigans out of here. We need to hold a lot of these web3 companies accountable. That's why I'm starting to get away from web2 and web3 differentiation, because the people who are developing in the community in the real world can use the tools. But, if the music doesn't hit with the crowd or community, you see investors buy it up but let's say -- I make 100 grand and I sell a bunch of NFTs but only sell to 8 people. Now when I do a show in your city, is it those 8 people? We need to do alternatives to what exists. But we need to hold platforms to hold them to a certain degree.
* Break: Bronxland and Rocky Sneider...
