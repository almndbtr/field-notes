### Rules

1. One voice at a time - If you talk over people we will give you a warning if it happens repeatedly you will be moved to the audience
2. No Shilling zone - Donâ€™t sell us but feel free to tell us your story
3. Keep it in the middle- We can attach issues and topics but attacking people wonâ€™t be tolerated
4. Step up step back - If your talking a lot please step back and leave space for other voices if you are being quiet please step up and talk if your on stage (please donâ€™t sit on stage silently we need your voice)
5. Feel free to share the room if itâ€™s valuable
