### Notes

* Aces Before Spaces‚Ñ¢Ô∏è&#x20;
  * Sharing our day publicly
  * Music in the background
* Start of meeting :tada:
  * Please request up if you want to speak. :thumbsup:
  * James: going through Ground Rules‚Ñ¢Ô∏è ‚úä
  *   James: To give a little background -- a lot of what we delved into last time -- let's add more. What should be more important: the tech or the art?

      * Pat: the art is more important. Reason: the technology -- we're at a space where the technology will continue to evolve. That's inevitable. We're seeing a bunch of success in the web3 space. We're seeing sound.xyz doing their thing with seasonal drops. We're seeing people getting onboarded to Catalog (shout-out to Jamee Cornelia!). There's a bunch of stuff that's going on in the space where the technology is advancing. In our group chat that we have, Black Dave was talking about the importance of party bids. Anyone that participates in party bids can create their own governance coin. We've gotten to a point where in Zora, you can actually mint it and anyone with governance token can make the cost of your mint whatever your governance token you have in your party bid. People who built this last thing, can do this new thing. The technology is going to continue to advance. That's inevitable. As far as artists are concerned, we should focus on two things, which would be the art, but also, the marketing of our art. What does roll out look like for web3? When we had this last conversation, art should be presented with excellence. If that means artist development with professionals, or getting piano lessons, whatever that looks like! Collaborating has helped developed me last few years. Being in spaces with artists I look up to. People who keep it real with me and not just be BobbleHeads‚Ñ¢Ô∏è -- they just nod. I don't want them around. Let's make it better. My thing is, I want my art to be presented with excellence. I am not afraid of critique and make sure to do this extremely well. South Paw Swade and James are in that, and I send music to South Paw often. So, I think that's important when actually wanting to create great art. Making it the best. You want it to be impactful and the more excellent it is, the more impactful. Those are my 2 cents!
      * James: I see some new faces in the crowd. If this conversation is going over your head, interrupt and ask questions. The point of this is not to hear ourselves speak, but we don't want that to be the vibe. If you feel like we're talking about something, let's help&#x20;
      * Almond: [https://podcastnotes.org/crypto/bankless/5-mental-models-for-web3-chris-dixon-on-the-bankless-podcast-with-ryan-sean-adams-and-david-hoffman/](https://podcastnotes.org/crypto/bankless/5-mental-models-for-web3-chris-dixon-on-the-bankless-podcast-with-ryan-sean-adams-and-david-hoffman/)
      * Pat: I appreciate that aspect of it! Welcome everyone that's here with us. To reset the room, we are the web3 Black Notes -- is it the tech or the art?
      * James re-asks the question: What should be more important -- the tech or the art?
      * celia inside: I am going to go with Almond on this one. For this particular convo, the tech is first in my mind anyway for someone who is looking for the most strategic way to enter the space right now. There is so much changing right now, daily, in the music world, and I need to have a full understanding of it on what I'm getting into, and asking others to get involved. That way, I'm very tuned to the tech side of it and trying to learn a little bit every day. There's this mad rush it seems, on this collectors wanting to collect, but I'm looking for the right moment where my art and the web3 world will cross in a natural way in a way that I'm ready for too. I'm doing my thing on the art side of it and going to get ready for that opportune moment. "celia inside" -- song by The Cardigans, which is by a band I really like
      * Pat: for gents on stage, I see your hands going up -- we have this thing for the women coming into the space, called the Uno Skip Card.
      * Iman: I'm going to say the art. I'm new to the tech side of things. I'm learning everything that I can about the tech, but the tech does not move without the art. Tech is made to make the art move. The art can move without the tech. You get what I'm saying tho? You make the tech for the art, and you push the art forward. That's what we have to continue to prioritize. Everyone should focus on what they believe is the most important thing -- for tech, tech, and for art, art. It's not about being all the same person. That's a cult. But coming together and doing what is best for what's best at -- you have both, or business and other areas, and we put that all in the pot. There's no right answer, but my answer is the art as that is what I'm most familiar with.
        * Pat: I'm on the art -- I agree with you wholeheartedly.
      * YahZarah.ETH: After being in the music space for over 20 years, they understand becoming a patron of the art. I am offering them utility and relationship. Two things that may not happen again. Getting to hug me and spending time with me, may not happen again. NFTs opens have another way to have relationships. Tech is driven by what we create. To me, it is the art and tech moving hand-in-hand, but most importantly the art.&#x20;
      * dav: Shout out for having this room! I'm always trying to nerd out on this. I love this kind of question. Love the UNO SKIP CARD RULE, and sometimes it's hard to make space for the ladies sometimes. Appreciate you all for keeping track.
        * For me, art comes first. But there is art in the tech. If we can use the tech in artful ways, like other artists, there's ways we can tell stories -- I'm a musician, so as a producer, so for me, how do I make tech that deepens concept of the song? I have a song that I am putting out that is called 99 cents and it is about value. Every time it gets traded, the song degrades like something would over time. Having that, tech component, I could not have done that on Spotify or on a vinyl. We have to see what the potential of the medium is -- talking like coders, or learning solidity. I've been learning how to make that happen, and it's been hard and weird and strange and exciting, but this is the frontier and we get to explore that. As much fun as it is in the room, we chase down some cool stuff -- we get to do that on tech side and concept side and make our own crazy stuff that can further the medium and make the experience as an owner, and as a listener, something that's more desirable to have. We're making things that are art pieces, but if people don't want to own them, or have it on Spotify playlist than wallet, that's kind of an issue - so what do we want to do to make this more valuable?
      * Kizzy: gm everyone! I see follows, will follow back. I agree with dav -- embracing the tech, can be artful. I have seen when the internet became user-friendly, some artists took to it while others did not embrace it. To answer the question, the art is more important to me, but the tech is what makes things move. There's nothing new under the sun, except for tech. We've been talking about love and war and sex since beginning of time. But now, with new things -- tech, built the neighborhoods. Twitter - 10 11 years ago, it was all tech and IT bros. It was not the best place, but artists made it cool to me. It would be all the same derivative shit if it wasn't for artists ... someone has been supporting me as a fan of the art, but he's been an angel investor and didn't know anything about the tech, but had some crypto and one NFT. And he wanted to support me in that way. Hey, this is a learning curve, but I will reward you to support me on web3. You have to climb this huge learning curve by design -- there's the weirdness behind it, but it's a beautiful technology, which has a steep learning curve, and if you come to support me, I will make this so much better for you. That's the beauty of the tech and the smart contract. I'm a big BandCamp and made racks off that, and you can do cool things with experiential things and you get all these things, with my drops on the blockchain, because of pandemic, I'm going to send you very intentional merch -- old and new. This blockchain is so new and daunting for so many reasons, but giving people tangible things -- that's something.
        * Pat: what's really dope and what I'm excited for -- this is not a slight to anyone at all. I want to preface that, but anyone that knows about BandCamp, making items, t-shirts, or merch -- you can couple T-shirts, casette tapes, and literally anything with the music. Someone can buy the whole package, so I want to see what other people do in this space. I'm excited about that. Thank you so much for that. \[Reset the room]
      * DANIEL: I appreciate you hosting the space. dav stole everything I wanted to say. As an artist, we prioritize the art. But there's cool ways to integrate the tech in what we do to support our artistic messages. Whether metaphorical or start the beginning of that -- the tech is there. But it's important to make sure that it makes sense along with the art.&#x20;
      * NOYZ: \[... Almond got rugged, missed this input]
        * Pat: I can appreciate that aspect for sure. Did anyone want to reply that's been said recently?
        * YahZarah.ETH: Thanks for being so gracious \[Pat]. When I look at this tech situation, there are some people who are in tech that wouldn't have looked for me in web2. To bring myself to the tech, brought them to me, that web3 is an opportunity to reach out that would have never found us and attached to us not because of the music but because of our stories. This is an environment built on symbiosis. We are literally helping each other \[...]
        * Doze: I have a question to ask! No shade in asking. Does there have to be a winner? That's a divisive way to look at it. Living life is art, in some people's opinions. So what is art and what isn't? I'm getting into semantics, but if we approach -- in web3, we have community and include each other and love the skip cards for women for sure, but at the same time, what's more important, are we not putting that divisiveness in the whole space of tech versus art? Just to think about it -- talking as artists, but curious what you all thought about that in general.&#x20;
          * James: it's my question. I see how it -- when I look at space, what is the driving force that makes something successful? Is it because of the art or what the tech can do? I dug into this -- what would give it a more sustainable success? If art is cool, but no tech, what would that look like? I'm not claiming one side over the other. But some people will think art is most important part, but not about the tech -- but I want to the challenge that thought. You should probably look at both sides: with art or with tech. Look into more -- it means something.
            * Doze: for project success -- it's middle ground answer. Yin and yang, some of each. Someone that codes and art, coding can be art too! Appreciate you letting me ask this question and extending grace.
            * Pat: Of course, you are welcome! It's a question to pull insight and answers out of people too. Whichever you want to be more important, one or the other, you will do both -- but before you came in, he asked the question -- "well, do I have to choose one?" the reason: in the last room, we were talking about -- "which one? which one is more important?" I said both need to be done in excellence. They need to be done in an excellent capacity. If you need that help, to do it best as can, you need a team. You need someone that can help you utilize this as best as possible. I believe in creative socialid using the art to help others as well. Question was posed to just get good insight, and it's not meant to pit each other --&#x20;
            * James: I was waiting for someone to ask the question!
            * Doze: It makes sense. There doesn't have to be a winner! If you don't want to do the research, you need a team to help you. It has to be excellent all around, esp in the art world!
            * Pat: we talked about that last time. Top-Tier Mid‚Ñ¢Ô∏è \[Reset the room / share if you like it!]
